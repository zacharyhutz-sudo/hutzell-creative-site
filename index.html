Zach is a graduate student studying horticulture, and Avery is a full-time graphic designer for a local nonprofit. In every spare moment they have, they love creating together.

        <h3 class="about-note-title">Note from the Hutzells:</h3>
        <p>
          Thank you for visiting and supporting Hutzell Creative Co. We’re constantly humbled by the opportunities to meet and celebrate such sweet clients, family, and friends. At the heart of our work and our marriage is our faith in Jesus — the One who gives meaning to all we do. Our hope, joy, and rest come from Him, and we believe that true beauty and creativity are reflections of His goodness and grace. We’re grateful for every story we get to tell, and we pray our work encourages and uplifts others along the way. If you ever wonder where our strength comes from, it’s not from us — our faith isn’t in our own efforts but in what Christ has already done. Without the Lord and without the support of our community, we wouldn’t be who we are today. It’s our greatest joy to use our gifts to serve others, tell stories, and capture moments that last.
        </p>
