        Zach and Avery Hutzell are the husband-and-wife team behind Hutzell Creative Co. Zach is a graduate student studying horticulture, and Avery is a full-time graphic designer for a local nonprofit. In every spare moment they have, they love creating together. Nothing excites them more than walking alongside people as they celebrate life’s biggest moments — from starting a business to starting a life together in marriage.

      <h3 class="about-note-title">Note from the Hutzells:</h3>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting and supporting Hutzell Creative Co.! We are so blessed to have a creative outlet that allows us to meet and celebrate such sweet clients, family, and friends.
        At the heart of our work and our marriage is our faith in Jesus Christ. We want our lives and our business to reflect the hope we’ve found in Him. As Paul writes in Ephesians 2, “by grace you have been saved through faith… it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.” That truth grounds us daily — reminding us that our worth isn’t in our own efforts but in what Christ has already done.
        Without the Lord and without the support of our community, we wouldn’t be who we are today. It’s our greatest joy to use our gifts to serve others, tell stories, and capture moments that last.
      </p>
