# Services Page Setup
- Rename in nav to **Services** (done).
- `index.html` uses `VIDEO_1` in the hero feature. Replace with your YouTube ID.
- `services.html` has two embeds: `VIDEO_1` and `VIDEO_2`. Replace with your IDs.

## Add photos
1. Upload your images to `assets/img/gallery/` (JPG/PNG/WebP).
2. Edit `assets/gallery.json` and add entries like:
   { "src": "assets/img/gallery/myphoto.jpg", "alt": "Bride walking down aisle" }

## Mouse interaction
- Photos tilt toward the cursor (subtle 3D).
- Click any photo to open a lightbox overlay.

## Contact form
- In `contact.html`, replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your Formspree ID.
